For better understanding, look at it this way **{diceroll (2), diceroll (6) , diceroll (2) * decider (2) = 4 , diceroll (5) }** ,where **sum= {2 + 6 + 4+5} // 17.**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nWe now have a clearer picture of the result we want to achieve, so let‚Äôs proceed to adding our formula and see if we nailed this challenge or neh.\n\n\n![1_vV-2GyairwusQLyO2A662g.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1588208111963/R6jHUnGpw.png)\n\n\n![1_ujPPyuTi3c3sioHaH22vmg.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1588208143909/TJhtL9Y38.png)\n\n\n![1_y8KxEIBggk4cauZyN3raeg.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1588208172192/kW70PXi6S.png)\n\nWell there we have it, the formula worked and our program is running fine, we all are different and we have other ways of solving this said challenge and that‚Äôs what makes us unique, this is my thought process, i hope you enjoyed it.\n\nThanks for reading, please leave your seats behind üòä","hasPolls":false,"totalPollVotes":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"tags":["56744721958ef13879b94a30"],"untaggedFrom":[],"upvotedBy":[],"downvotedBy":[],"popularity":3908.64,"responses":[],"responseCount":0,"replyCount":0,"followers":[],"isActive":true,"isFeatured":false,"isEngaging":false,"answeredByTarget":false,"inviters":[],"isDelisted":false,"isNotified":false,"duplicatePosts":[],"numCollapsed":0,"hasReward":false,"bookmarkedIn":[],"similarPostIds":["5cf0f9e01483fa914ca8232c","5eba727b4a6b9627679b4751","5d0cc462ab5c14a023b51378","5d0e124cdfe6c95d4d8af2f6","5d921f8d7b482cba7cb731ce","5b2ce4d23d30795551d42f67","5d1a374ac46019af7a181ab9","5d1af98028c857e515adf9ef","5ea6eab50135fc417663060a","5e3089b8fc003cfb0c63907d","5e26e50a7a1d3fcc590342e4","5ce66330ba53abee499653c2","5dbcaad9aaa616c464d62b35","5e00b1d3339f878d7266f34b","5eab653826e78ca711df8fb7","5d1f2b9fe2b875114e4aed1f","5ee0aa8d304fa1181a7d5586","5e9fb5c80135fc41766298cb","5d1601b50230c7616fa8a3fc","5dd67fd5b1d6818f010302e9","5e8926022fcec10052c1035a","5e1add967a1d3fcc590267ab","5e5aa79a8c89a92316ce5adc","5ec25737a4db0c222f223321","5d6addf21f2e6adb2e474539","5d3701044cf029c92f48686d","5dd2866dc94ff0fb77ebaf75","5dd531778f80966d489904ab","5e80ee0bba34afe713b7ce3c","5d3448cb42bbe8fa52f1b3b0"],"reactions":["567453d0b73d6a82ac8c5abd"],"totalReactions":1,"reactionsByCurrentUser":[],"isPinnedToBlog":false,"disableComments":false,"hasLatex":false,"_id":"5eab362126e78ca711df8edd","hasPinnedTag":false,"draft":"5ea991e611f7dbcc529c4742","followersCount":1,"author":"5e00c3b463a8929272c3393d","title":"How I solve coding challenges using The ‚ÄúStart small grow big‚Äù and ‚ÄúThink twice,code once‚Äù method","type":"story","isRepublished":false,"originalArticleURL":"","partOfPublication":true,"publication":"5e00c55b339f878d7266f378","slug":"how-i-solve-coding-challenges-using-the-start-small-grow-big-and-think-twice-code-once-method","cuid":"fcc80fd0e94","importedFromMedium":true,"hasCustomDate":true,"series":null,"contributors":[],"questionReplies":[],"dateAdded":"2020-03-22T18:00:00.000Z","pollOptions":[],"__v":0,"reactionToCountMap":{"reaction_567453d0b73d6a82ac8c5abd":1},"badges":[],"uniqueReactions":["567453d0b73d6a82ac8c5abd"],"reactionToCountMapUnique":{"reaction_567453d0b73d6a82ac8c5abd":1,"reaction_5c090d96c2a9c2a674d35484":0},"id":"5eab362126e78ca711df8edd"},{"reward":{"type":"xlm"},"sourcedFromGithub":false,"isAnonymous":false,"views":12,"slugOverridden":false,"coverImage":"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1588170484614/DXkttVEUJ.jpeg","brief":"What Being a Team-Lead Means To Me (My Hng Pre-Internship and Internship Experience)\n\n\nI know this is not a C# coding secret or anything, this article is about my journey in tech, please enjoy.\n\nI applied for the Hotels.ng Pre-internship or otherwise...","content":"<h1 id=\"what-being-a-team-lead-means-to-me-my-hng-pre-internship-and-internship-experience-\">What Being a Team-Lead Means To Me (My Hng Pre-Internship and Internship Experience)</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1588170396324/oHSlLCq2z.jpeg\" alt=\"4vHpZnpa.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know this is not a C# coding secret or anything, this article is about my journey in tech, please enjoy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I applied for the Hotels.ng Pre-internship or otherwise known as Start.ng program during the month of August 2019 which lasted for 3 weeks and also the Hotels.ng internship 6.0 during the month of September ‚Äî November 2019 and I must say it was a rewarding experience as I got the chance to taste and see what it means to work alongside people from different countries, states , tribes,and works of life as interns.

Lets go ahead to call the validateEmail() function and receive an input which will serve as the argument passed for \"enterEmail\", we can enter any email format to check if it is really validating.\n\n\n\n\n![Screenshot (560).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1577233828065/dkZ2OZxFG.png)\n\n\nNotice there that the email format entered is ‚Äútobby@mail‚Äù which obviously is not a valid email address so it returns a message ‚ÄúYour mailing address is not valid‚Äù but using \"tobby@gmail.com\" returns a message ‚Äúyour mailing address is valid‚Äù.\n\n\n\n![Screenshot (561).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1577233815915/bw2tHNz7w.png)\n\n\nSo there we have it folks, the power of the EndsWith() method, you can do much more than this, if you enjoyed the article kindly leave a comment  üëç. \n\nGracias.","hasPolls":false,"totalPollVotes":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"tags":["56744721958ef13879b94a30","56744723958ef13879b9556e","56744723958ef13879b952e1","56744721958ef13879b94d1d"],"untaggedFrom":[],"upvotedBy":[],"downvotedBy":[],"popularity":3737.9832,"responses":[],"responseCount":0,"replyCount":0,"followers":[],"isActive":true,"isFeatured":false,"isEngaging":false,"answeredByTarget":false,"inviters":[],"isDelisted":false,"isNotified":false,"duplicatePosts":[],"numCollapsed":0,"hasReward":false,"bookmarkedIn":[],"similarPostIds":["5ea02ce90135fc4176629dbc","5cf0f9e01483fa914ca8232c","5e9ed97012892a3c760b2d4c","5d0cc462ab5c14a023b51378","5968c08c42f62428125fde7a","5c00d2c3bfb0f60a2be39ecf","5d331f1260ed72b558632eae","5ce66330ba53abee499653c2","5a7e1f1a78dcafc230d408cf","5efdb57199983e5b54bf1e50","5d1a374ac46019af7a181ab9","5ea80ba012892a3c760ba361","5dd67fd5b1d6818f010302e9","5eed0d4ff4262384494bfe7d","5ec98272123fdcb70b92edce","5e5aa79a8c89a92316ce5adc","5d3701044cf029c92f48686d","5e7e154f981875d76a02128d","5d1f2b9fe2b875114e4aed1f","5e1add967a1d3fcc590267ab","5dd531778f80966d489904ab","5d3448cb42bbe8fa52f1b3b0","5ee9e19989a644767917578f","5dbac7ca776cc77856f592fa","5d6addf21f2e6adb2e474539","5eab653826e78ca711df8fb7","5eab362126e78ca711df8edd","5d31998c8d104a701de139de","5e218fee32d5fad159b6ffbc","5e00b1d3339f878d7266f34b"],"reactions":[],"totalReactions":0,"reactionsByCurrentUser":[],"isPinnedToBlog":false,"disableComments":false,"hasLatex":false,"_id":"5e0279e1704130b8432b1007","hasPinnedTag":false,"isRepublished":false,"draft":"5e027429704130b8432b0f41","followersCount":1,"author":"5e00c3b463a8929272c3393d","cuid":"ck4kceqi5000rdks1iakswnxz","slug":"how-to-do-a-mail-validation-check-with-endswith","title":"How to do a mail validation check with EndsWith()","type":"story","partOfPublication":true,"publication":"5e00c55b339f878d7266f378","hasCustomDate":true,"contributors":[],"questionReplies":[],"dateAdded":"2019-12-24T20:47:22.860Z","pollOptions":[],"__v":0,"series":null,"dateUpdated":"2019-12-25T00:31:08.110Z","pendingPublicationApproval":false,"badges":[],"uniqueReactions":[],"reactionToCountMapUnique":{"any":1},"id":"5e0279e1704130b8432b1007"}]}
